A Yolov8 detection model that segments nails in images.

The model can be used as an [ADetailer](https://github.com/Bing-su/adetailer) model (for [Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/) / Stable Diffusion use), or using other [inference scripts](https://github.com/MNeMoNiCuZ/yolov8-scripts) to return detection bounding boxes of watermarks.

The model is entirely trained on the following dataset:
[Personal Projects/Nails Segmentation](https://universe.roboflow.com/personal-projects-jfbag/nails_segmentation)


A tutorial and code how to use the model can be found on this Github: https://github.com/MNeMoNiCuZ/yolov8-scripts or this [CivitAI article](https://civitai.com/articles/4080/training-a-custom-adetailer-model-with-yolov8-detection-model).
